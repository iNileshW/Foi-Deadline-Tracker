## 2026-07-16 — Bootstrap: CLAUDE.md

**Goal:** Give future AI sessions a grounded briefing.

**Files:**
- `CLAUDE.md` (new)

**Rationale:** Prototype inherited with no project doc for AI collaborators.
CLAUDE.md captures the ICO-audit definition of done, the known defects
with file:line references, the architecture, the run steps, and the
priority directions from the hackathon brief.

**Verification:** Cross-checked defect list against `app.py`, `deadlines.py`,
`seed.py`, `README.md`.

## 2026-07-16 — Fix statutory deadline calculation (bank holidays)

**Goal (set via `/goal`):** fix the deadline calculation first.

**Files:**
- `deadlines.py` (rewritten)
- `bank_holidays.json` (new — cached GOV.UK feed)
- `tests/__init__.py` (new)
- `tests/test_deadlines.py` (new — 10 tests)
- `requirements-dev.txt` (new — adds pytest)

**Rationale:** Old `calculate_deadline` skipped Sat/Sun only. Bank holidays
counted as working days, which produced deadlines earlier than the ICO
rule and caused the statutory breach cited in the brief (request received
Maundy Thursday 2026-04-02: old code returned 2026-04-30; correct
deadline per FOIA s10(6) + ICO guidance is 2026-05-05, three working days
later).

**Design choices:**
- Bank-holiday list sourced from `https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json`,
  division `england-and-wales`.
- Feed cached to `bank_holidays.json` on disk so the app and tests run
  offline. `load_bank_holidays(refresh=True)` re-fetches on demand.
- `calculate_deadline(received, holidays=None)` — `holidays` is
  dependency-injectable for tests; production callers keep the original
  one-arg signature.
- Count starts the working day after receipt (day 0 = receipt itself).
  Deadline is the 20th such working day.

**Test coverage:**
- `test_maundy_thursday_2026_scenario` — the brief's breach case.
- `test_maundy_thursday_vs_weekend_only_differs` — regression guard vs.
  the old behaviour (asserts both old and new expected dates).
- `test_no_holidays_in_window` — clean 20-working-day window.
- `test_received_on_weekend_clock_starts_monday`.
- `test_received_on_bank_holiday`.
- `test_christmas_window_2026` — Christmas Day + Boxing Day substitute.
- `test_easter_2025` — separate year to guard year-specific bugs.
- `test_ico_day_zero_rule` — receipt date not counted.
- `test_deadline_is_always_a_working_day` — invariant across a
  60-day sweep of receipt dates.
- `test_holidays_none_uses_cached_file` — offline cache smoke test.

**Verification:** `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` → 10 passed in 0.02s.

**Follow-ups (not done here):**
- Existing `foi.db` still holds deadlines computed under the old logic.
  Reseed with `python seed.py` (destructive — flagged separately in
  CLAUDE.md as a seed-script defect).
- `seed.py` and `app.py` unchanged; both call `calculate_deadline`
  with the same signature so no callers were broken.

## 2026-07-16 — Fix SQL injection across all four query sites

**Goal:** fix the SQL injection next.

**Files:**
- `app.py` (rewritten queries)
- `tests/test_sql_injection.py` (new — 6 tests)

**Rationale:** Every query in the inherited `app.py` interpolated user
input into the SQL string with f-strings. The search box on `/` was the
most obvious vector, but `POST /new`, `POST /request/<id>` and
`GET /request/<id>` were equally exposed. Under the ICO audit, an
auditable, injection-free query path is table-stakes for both data
protection and integrity.

**Changes to `app.py`:**
- `/` search: `LIKE ? OR LIKE ?` with the `%q%` wrapping done in
  Python, values passed as `execute()` parameters.
- `/new` INSERT: seven-column parameter tuple; status literal
  stays inline.
- `/request/<int:req_id>` UPDATE and SELECT: `?` placeholders for
  status, notes, and id.
- Removed the "quick search feature" and "change this at some point"
  comments — they were project archaeology, not code documentation.
  Left one `TODO` marker on the dev `secret_key` because that's the
  next security fix.

**Route-level defence retained:** `/request/<int:req_id>` still uses
Flask's `int` path converter, so a path such as `/request/1;DROP` 404s
before the view function runs. A dedicated test locks that in.

**Test coverage (all against a per-test throwaway SQLite DB via a
`monkeypatch` fixture):**
- `test_search_drop_table_neutralised` — classic `'; DROP TABLE …; --`
  payload; row count remains 1 afterwards.
- `test_search_union_leak_neutralised` — `%' UNION SELECT sql,… FROM
  sqlite_master --` payload; response contains neither schema text nor
  the seeded row.
- `test_search_literal_apostrophe_is_safe` — a bare apostrophe used to
  crash the query; now returns 200 with an empty result set.
- `test_new_request_persists_apostrophes` — `O'Brien`, mixed quotes and
  semicolons round-trip intact through the INSERT path.
- `test_detail_update_preserves_hostile_notes` — hostile notes stored
  verbatim; `requests` table intact.
- `test_detail_route_rejects_non_integer_id` — Flask converter rejects
  non-integer id with 404.

**Verification:** `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` → 16 passed in 0.11s
(10 deadline + 6 injection).

**Follow-ups (next):**
- Committed dev `secret_key = "dev"` and `debug=True` still ship.
  Move both to env-sourced config; disable debug in production.
- No authentication yet — audit-log question ("who changed this record
  and when") is still unanswerable.

## 2026-07-16 — Publish to GitHub

**Goal:** commit code to `https://github.com/iNileshW/Foi-Deadline-Tracker`.

**Files:**
- `.gitignore` (new — excludes `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.pytest_cache/`,
  `foi.db`, `*.db`, virtualenvs, `.env`)

**Actions:**
- `git init -b main`
- Remote `origin` set to the URL above.
- Verified remote was empty via `git ls-remote` before pushing — no
  divergence to reconcile.
- `foi.db` deliberately excluded from the repo: it is a runtime artefact
  recreated by `seed.py`, and the seed rows are sample PII-shaped data.
- `bank_holidays.json` **is** committed — it is a cache the app reads
  at runtime and lets tests run offline.
- Commit `01fb753` on `main`, 17 files, root commit.
- Pushed with `git push -u origin main`.

**Commit message summarises:** the deadline fix (with the Maundy
Thursday 2026-04-02 → 2026-05-05 correction), the SQL-injection
rewrite across all four query sites, and the 16-test pytest suite.

## 2026-07-16 — Move secret key and debug mode out of source

**Goal:** fix the secret_key and debug mode next.

**Files:**
- `app.py` (secret-loading helper, env-sourced debug/port/DB)
- `tests/conftest.py` (new — sets dev flag before app import)
- `tests/test_config.py` (new — 6 tests)
- `.env.example` (new)
- `README.md` (env vars documented, test invocation added)
- `CLAUDE.md` (defect list re-scored: three items now closed)

**Rationale:** `secret_key = "dev"` and `debug=True` were both hardcoded
in the inherited `app.py`. A dev secret in source means anyone with
repo read access can forge sessions; `debug=True` exposes the Werkzeug
console (RCE if reachable). ICO audit around access control cannot be
passed while either of these ships.

**Design choices:**
- `FOI_SECRET_KEY` is the *only* accepted way to configure the secret
  in production. `_load_secret_key()` raises `RuntimeError` on import
  if it is missing, so the app cannot silently degrade.
- The dev override is intentionally noisy: `FOI_ALLOW_INSECURE_DEV_SECRET=1`
  (exact string `"1"`, not `true` / `yes`). Only when this is set and
  `FOI_SECRET_KEY` is unset do we generate an ephemeral secret via
  `secrets.token_hex(32)`. Sessions do not survive process restart —
  by design, so developers feel the pain and set a real key.
- Debug flag: `FLASK_DEBUG=1` opt-in. Default off. Port and DB path
  also env-driven (`PORT`, `FOI_DB`).
- Existing tests import `app` module → the new import-time check would
  break them. Fixed with `tests/conftest.py`, which is loaded by pytest
  before any test module and sets the dev flag.

**Test coverage (`tests/test_config.py`):**
- `test_secret_key_from_env` — happy path.
- `test_dev_fallback_is_random_and_non_empty` — two calls return
  different values, each ≥32 chars, never the literal `"dev"`.
- `test_missing_secret_raises` — both env vars unset → `RuntimeError`
  whose message mentions `FOI_SECRET_KEY`.
- `test_dev_flag_other_value_does_not_bypass` — the string `"true"`
  does *not* enable the fallback. Only `"1"`.
- `test_app_import_fails_without_secret` — spawns a fresh
  `python -c "import app"` with a scrubbed env. This is the true
  production regression guard, and it can't be done via monkeypatch
  because `app` is already imported in the current test process.
- `test_debug_mode_defaults_off` — `app.debug is False` on the
  constructed Flask instance.

**Verification:** `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` → 22 passed in 0.24s
(10 deadline + 6 injection + 6 config).

**Follow-ups (next):**
- Authentication + per-user accounts (two directorates joining).
- Audit log of record changes (`who`, `when`, `what`).
- Kill the destructive `seed.py` (it deletes `foi.db` unconditionally).
- Pin dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

## 2026-07-16 — Push config-hardening commit to GitHub

**Goal:** commit changes to repo.

**Files pushed:**
- 4 modified: `AI_Log.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `app.py`
- 3 new: `.env.example`, `tests/conftest.py`, `tests/test_config.py`

**Commit:** `780a009` on `main`, fast-forward from `01fb753`.
**Push:** `git push origin main` → `01fb753..780a009  main -> main`.

## 2026-07-16 — Add session authentication and CSRF protection

**Goal:** add authentication next.

**Files:**
- `users.py` (new — `User` dataclass, password hashing, `authenticate`)
- `auth.py` (new — `login_required`, session helpers, CSRF)
- `app.py` (login/logout routes; `@login_required` on all existing
  routes; CSRF `before_request`; hardened session cookies)
- `create_user.py` (new — CLI to add users, password read from stdin)
- `seed.py` (calls `init_users_table`; no seeded users)
- `templates/base.html` (top-bar user + sign-out button)
- `templates/login.html` (new)
- `templates/new.html`, `templates/detail.html` (hidden CSRF field)
- `tests/test_sql_injection.py` (fixture now creates a logged-in
  session and adds `_csrf` to POST bodies)
- `tests/test_auth.py` (new — 15 tests)
- `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` updated

**Rationale:** Two directorates joining means multi-team, real users,
and personal data. The ICO auditor will ask *who* accessed a record —
that question is unanswerable without identities. Auth is the
prerequisite for the audit log that comes next.

**Design choices:**
- Handrolled session auth on top of Flask's signed cookie session,
  no `flask-login` / `flask-wtf` dependencies. Fewer moving parts;
  no new install steps for the hackathon environment.
- Password hashing via `werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash`
  (already in the Flask dep tree). PBKDF2 by default; upgrade-in-place
  possible without a schema change because Werkzeug encodes the
  algorithm in the stored string.
- Password minimum length: 12 characters. Enforced in `create_user`,
  covered by a test.
- CSRF: per-session token in `session["csrf_token"]`, submitted as
  hidden `_csrf` form field, verified in `before_request` for all
  mutating verbs (including `/login` and `/logout`). Constant-time
  compare via `secrets.compare_digest`.
- Session cookie hardening: `HTTPOnly` always on, `SameSite=Lax`,
  `Secure` behind the `FOI_SECURE_COOKIES=1` env var so production
  can opt in without breaking `http://localhost` dev.
- Session rotation on login (`session.clear()` before setting
  `user_id`) to defeat session-fixation attacks.
- `?next=` open-redirect guard: only relative URLs starting with `/`
  are honoured; anything else falls back to `/`.
- Login failure returns HTTP 401 with a generic "Invalid email or
  password." message — no distinction between "unknown email",
  "wrong password", or "account disabled". Prevents user enumeration.
- No RBAC yet. Role and team live on `users` but no route consults
  them. Flagged as follow-up in CLAUDE.md.

**Test coverage (`tests/test_auth.py`, 15 tests):**
- Three unauthenticated routes redirect to `/login`.
- Wrong password → 401; unknown email → 401 (same status; enumeration
  guard).
- Successful login → 302; protected route now returns 200.
- Logout clears session; protected route redirects afterwards.
- CSRF: POST without token → 400; POST with wrong token → 400.
- Password not stored plaintext; stored hash starts with a known
  algorithm prefix.
- Disabled user (via `disabled_at` timestamp) cannot log in.
- `?next=https://evil.example.com/...` is ignored; redirect stays
  on-site.
- `create_user` refuses passwords shorter than 12 chars and unknown
  roles.
- Session id is rotated on login (pre-login session keys wiped).

**Existing tests updated:** `tests/test_sql_injection.py` fixture now
initialises the `users` table, opens a `session_transaction`, sets
`user_id` and a known `csrf_token`, and each POST test includes the
matching `_csrf` field. No behavioural regressions; all six original
injection tests still pass.

**Verification:** `python3 -m pytest tests/` → 37 passed, no warnings
(10 deadline + 6 injection + 6 config + 15 auth).

**Deprecation cleanup:** `users.py` uses `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
instead of `datetime.utcnow()` to silence a Python 3.13
DeprecationWarning.

**Follow-ups (next):**
- Audit log: `record_changes(user_id, request_id, before, after,
  timestamp)`. Populate on POST /new and POST /request/<id>.
- RBAC: gate destructive edits or admin-only routes on `role`.
- Team-based data separation: add `team` to `requests`, filter
  index/detail queries by `current_user.team` for non-admins.
- Rate limiting / lockout on `/login`.
- Kill the destructive `seed.py`.

## 2026-07-16 — Hotfix: auto-create users table on legacy databases

**Goal:** browser reported HTTP 500 on POST /login.

**Symptom:** `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: users`.

**Root cause:** the existing `foi.db` in the working tree was
pre-auth — created before the users table existed. `seed.py` now
creates the table, but users who did not re-seed (correct: seed is
destructive of `requests`) still had the old schema. The auth code
paths blew up on the first `SELECT ... FROM users` in `authenticate`.

**Fix:** call `init_users_table(conn)` inside `app.get_db()` on every
connection. It's a `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so it's idempotent
and cheap. Pre-auth databases pick up the users table transparently
the first time they hit any DB-backed route; already-migrated
databases are unaffected.

**Files:**
- `app.py` (`get_db` now calls `init_users_table`)

**Verification:**
- Full test suite still green: 37/37.
- Live reproduction with a fresh `foi.db` lacking the users table:
  - GET `/` → 302 to `/login`.
  - GET `/login` → 200, CSRF token issued.
  - POST `/login` (unknown user) → 401 (was 500).
  - The `users` table now exists in the database after the POST.
- Seeded `admin@dft.gov.uk` (role=admin, team=central) manually via
  `python3 -c "…create_user…"` to give the user a working local login.
  In production, `create_user.py EMAIL ROLE TEAM` is the intended path.

**Note on the earlier 500 during verification:** a Werkzeug dev server
from a previous run was still holding port 5002 after `kill` in an
earlier bash invocation. A fresh `fuser -k 5002/tcp` cleared it and
subsequent runs behaved correctly.
